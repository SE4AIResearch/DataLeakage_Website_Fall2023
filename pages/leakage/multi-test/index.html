         <h1>Multi-test Leakage</h1>
         <h3>What is multi-test leakage?</h3>
         <p>
            Multi-test leakage refers to a situation in which information from
            multiple tests or experiments is unintentionally shared or used in a
            way that compromises the validity or independence of the tests.
         </p>

         <h3>Causes of multi-test leakage:</h3>
         <p>
            Potential for multi-test leakage arises because the tokenization and
            padding processes are applied to the entire dataset before splitting
            it into training, validation, and test sets.
         </p>

         <h3>Solutions for multi-test leakage:</h3>
         <h4>Tokenization and padding within each split:</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Perform the tokenization and padding separately for the train,
               val, and test sets after the split.
            </li>
            <li>
               This ensures that the preprocessing steps are independent for
               each set, reducing the risk of info leak.
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h4>Tokenization and padding in a pipeline:</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Use a pipeline to encapsulate the tokenization and padding
               processes.
            </li>
            <li>
               This ensures that the same transformations are applied
               consistently across different sets.
            </li>
         </ul>

         <p>
            Overall, by applying tokenization and padding separately for each
            split, one can ensure that the information regarding the structure
            of the data (e.g., token sequences, padding) is not shared between
            the train, val, and test sets, reducing the risk of multi-test
            leakage.
         </p>

         <h3>Example of Muli-test Leakage Code Displayed Below</h3>
         <p>
            The tokenizer is fitted on the entire dataset, and tokenization and padding are applied to the entire dataset before splitting it. This introduces multi-test leakage because information from the validation and test sets influences the tokenization and padding process.

         <h3>Fix Multi-Test Leakage Displayed Below</h3>
         <p>
            Fix multi-test leakage by performing tokenization and padding within each split separately, ensuring that the tokenizer is fit only on the training data within each split. 
            <ul>
               <li>The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets before any preprocessing.</li>
               <li>Tokenization and padding are performed separately within each split, ensuring that the tokenizer is fit only on the training data within each split and applied consistently to tokenize and pad sequences for the training, validation, and test sets.</li>
               <li>This approach prevents multi-test leakage by ensuring that the preprocessing steps are independent for each split.</li>
            </ul>
