         <h2>Preprocessing Leakage</h2>

         <h3>What is preprocessing leakage?</h3>
         <p>
            Preprocessing leakage occurs when information from the test set
            influences the preprocessing steps applied to the training set.
         </p>

         <h3>Causes of preprocessing leakage:</h3>
         <p>
            If preprocessing steps are influenced by information from the test
            set, it can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates during
            model development and may result in poor generalization to new,
            unseen data.
         </p>

         <h3>Solutions for preprocessing leakage:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Perform Preprocessing Independently: Apply preprocessing steps
               based on information from the train set without considering the
               test set.
            </li>

            <li>
               Use Pipelines: Implement preprocessing steps within a pipeline to
               ensure consistency and prevent information flow between the
               training and test sets.
            </li>

            <li>
               Handle Missing Values Appropriately: If missing values are
               imputed, use methods based solely on information from the
               training set. Avoid using global statistics or values derived
               from the test set.
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Example of Preprocessing Leakage Code Displayed Below</h3>
         <p>
            In the example shown below, there is preprocessing leakage because there is no split before feature 
            selection.
         </p>

         <h3>Example of How Quick Fix Would Be Performed</h3>
         <p>
            When you hover and click on the highlighted issue, you can see the pop up that says "Potential preprocessing leakage associated with this
            variable. See Line 12 which contains the source of the leakage". To do the quick fix, you would click on the button underneath it "Perform split
            before feature selection".
         </p>

         <h3>Fix Preprocessing Leakage Displayed Below</h3>
         <p>
            In the fix, you can see that before the gbc.fit(X_train,y_train) line, the split() line is written before it.
