         <h2>Preprocessing Leakage</h2>

         <h3>What is preprocessing leakage?</h3>
         <p>
            Preprocessing leakage occurs when information from the test set
            influences the preprocessing steps applied to the training set.
         </p>

         <h3>Causes of preprocessing leakage:</h3>
         <p>
            If preprocessing steps are influenced by information from the test
            set, it can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates during
            model development and may result in poor generalization to new,
            unseen data.
         </p>

         <h3>Solutions for preprocessing leakage:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Perform Preprocessing Independently: Apply preprocessing steps
               based on information from the train set without considering the
               test set.
            </li>

            <li>
               Use Pipelines: Implement preprocessing steps within a pipeline to
               ensure consistency and prevent information flow between the
               training and test sets.
            </li>

            <li>
               Handle Missing Values Appropriately: If missing values are
               imputed, use methods based solely on information from the
               training set. Avoid using global statistics or values derived
               from the test set.
            </li>
         </ul>
