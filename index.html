      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
         Bad coding practices don't only happen in software development settings.
         Code written to train and evaluate machine learning (ML)
         models may contain bugs just like software code. Various forms of <i>data leakage</i>, 
         such indistinguishable training and test data, can lead to an overestimation of a model's
         accuracy, which in turn can lead to the deployment of a low quality model.
         Low quality models can do harm to the people that are supposed to benefit from them. There are several
         real-world examples of poor quality models that have been responsible for discrimination and death.
         Amazon had to stop using a recruiting tool that was created with ML because it showed bias against women. 
         A Tesla vehicle on autopilot once ran a red light and killed two people.
         There is no question that ML engineers have a duty to produce high quality models and avoid bad coding practices that cause data leakage. 
         Unfortunately, however, data leakage can be difficult to detect. Therefore, we aim to develop a tool (more specifically, an IDE plugin) that can detect common
         forms of data leakage in ML code.
