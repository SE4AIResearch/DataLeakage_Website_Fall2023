               I am a fifth-year computer science student at Stevens Institute
               of Technology in Hoboken, NJ. I am deeply engaged in campus life
               at Stevens. I serve as a teaching assistant for a graduate-level
               introductory computing class, am a student advisor to the Stevens
               CS Department, and am the President of Stevens Women in Computer
               Science (SWiCS). My work experience is diverse. I have worked on
               web internationalization for a photonics manufacturer, DevOps for
               an A/V equipment manufacturer, embedded software for household
               appliances, and desktop software for tactical communications.
               Aside from technology, I am passionate about music -- I am the
               Principal Violist of the Stevens Orchestra and a teacher & mentor
               to young music students.

               I am a 5/5 Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of
               Technology. I am eager to learn and grow as much as I can here at
               my time at Stevens, and I plan to make a career in a Computer
               Science job. More specifically I am interested in
               project/resource management, but right now I am taking the time
               to learn as much as I can to broaden my horizons.

               Hello, I am Suneedhi Laddha a 4/4 CS major and Qf minor. Over the
               years, I have gained experience in a variety of programming
               languages and frameworks. I have experience with basic machine
               learning and deep learning algorithms having taken CS 583 taught
               by Professor Tian Han and CS 559 taught by professor In Suk Jang.
               I also have experience with web development and am familiar with
               frameworks such as Nodejs and databases such as MongoDB and
               MySQL. Over the summer, I held an interned at Voya Financial in
               their application & development team where I aided in
               automatation of the QA tasks worked on by the QA team that my
               manager managed.

               About Me: I am a 5/5 Computer Science student at Stevens
               Institute of Technology. I'm excited to learn and am taking
               advantage of all the resources Stevens has to offer. I'm looking
               for any job having to do with computer science. I'm happy to
               tackle new challenges and love to solve complex problems. I'm
               currently trying to learn as much as I can about broad fields in
               computer science. I like to write poetry in my spare time.
