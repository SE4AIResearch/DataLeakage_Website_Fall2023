               About Me: I am a 5/5 Computer Science student at Stevens
               Institute of Technology. I'm excited to learn and am taking
               advantage of all the resources Stevens has to offer. I'm looking
               for any job having to do with computer science. I'm happy to
               tackle new challenges and love to solve complex problems. I'm
               currently trying to learn as much as I can about broad fields in
               computer science. I like to write poetry in my spare time.
